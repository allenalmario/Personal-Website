		<p id="intro_par">Hello, I am Allen Almario. I am a first generation Filipino-American and I was born in Guam, USA. I moved to Las Vegas, Nevada in 1999 and was rasied there. Then, I moved to Tacoma, Washington in 2008 and have been here ever since. I am a senior at the University of Washington Tacoma and it is my dream school, believe it or not. I feel more comfortable in small classes and that's why I chose to go to UW-Tacoma. I am a Senior, my major is Communications in the professional track and my minor is in Applied Computing. I graduate in June 2020, I will be the second to graduate from college and I am really excited! I hope to become a web designer and my plan is to persue a Master's Degree in Cybersecurity. <span id="fact">Fun fact: I've always wanted to learn about cybersecurity after watching the 1995 film 'Hackers' as a kid (to see more random facts about me, check out the <a href="facts.html">Random Facts</a> page).</span> I created this website about myself so you guys can get to know me better despite the current circumstances. Even though we did not meet in the traditional classroom, I can use this project as a way to introduce myself to my classmates. <span id="replace">Nothing will ever replace in person interaction</span>, but I hope this will do!</p>
