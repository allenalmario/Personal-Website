		<h2>Guam, USA</h2>
		<p>I was born here, so technically I have been here before. I don't remember much because I moved to the states when I was three years old. I have pictures though and the ones where I was at the beach, man the water looks so blue and clear. It looks exactly like the water on the picture to the left. I would like to visit someday but to be honest, I would rather go to the Philippines with the price of the ticket.</p>

		<h2>Las Vegas, Nevada</h2>
		<p>aka <span id="sin">Sin City</span>!! This place is truly my hometown. I was raised here so it holds a very special place in my heart. I visit a lot actually, probably every summer because I have family there still. Sadly, I can't go this summer because of the COVID-19 pandemic. One thing I don't enjoy when I go there is the <span id="hot">HEAT</span>. It gets really hot, the average temperature in Las Vegas during the summer is 104 degrees!! As a local, we really don't mind Vegas' biggest feature, The Strip. That is only a big deal for the tourist. It is good to have when you want to have fun every now and then, the entertainment capital of the world is in your backyard.</p>

		<h2>Los Angeles, California</h2>
		<p><span id="cali">*cue California Love by 2Pac*</span> This place is my most favorite location to travel to and have a vacation. Besides the dreadful traffic, the Los Angeles Kings/Rams, it's really fun! Everytime I go with my family, we always go to Universal Studios and Disneyland. The weather is perfect, always sunny and not too hot compared to Las Vegas. I honestly like it so much that I want to move there. </p>

		<h2>Philippines</h2>
		<p>I had some of the best experiences in my life so far in the Philippines. Something about visiting your motherland really hits different. The landscape is truly a tropic beauty. I visited my mom's hometown Roxas in the Isabela province, which is a real country area full of agriculture. My experience there truly made me appreciative of the simple stuff that we have here in the United States, such as hot water. Most places there do not have hot water, unless it's in the hotels.  Then I went to a place called El Nido, Palawan and I Island hopped with my girlfriend and family. This experience was super fun and the beaches are so beautiful. The warm and clear ocean water was the best part.</p>
